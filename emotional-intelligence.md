# Emotional Intelligence 2.0

### Travis Bradberry & Jean Greaves

---

- Emotional intelligence is your ability to recognize and understand emotions in yourself and others, and your ability to use this awareness to manage your behavior and relation ships.

- Emotional intelligence is a skill set that can be learned-and unlearned. Just as you can work hard to lose weight over the summer only to pack those pounds on again over the winter holidays.

- IQ, EQ and personality assessed together are the best way get a picture of the whole person. When you measure all three in a single individual, they don't overlap much. Instead, each covers unique ground that helps to explain what makes a person tick.

- When something generates a prolonged emotional reaction in you, it's called a "trigger event. Your reaction to your triggers is shaped by your personal history, which includes your experience with similar situations.

- When you don't take time out to notice and understand your emotions, they have a strange way of resurfacing when you least expect or want them to. It's their way of trying to bring something important to your attention. They will persist, and the damage will mount, until you take notice.

- Your hard-wired emotional reactions to anything come before you even have a chance to respond.

- Emotional intelligence skills-much like emotions themselves-are contagious. That means that our EQ skills are highly dependent on the surrounding people and circumstances. The more we interact with empathetic people, the more empathetic we become. The more time we spend with other people who openly discuss emotions, the more skilled we become at identifying and understanding emotions.

> Real results come from putting your momentary needs on hold to pursue larger, more important goals.

- **_Self-management_** Is more than resisting explosive or problematic behaviour. The biggest challenge that people face is managing their tendencies over time and applying their skills in a variety of situations.

- The surprising thing about self-awareness is that just thinking about it helps you improve the skill, even though much of your focus initially tends to be on what you do wrong. Having self-awareness means you aren't afraid of your emotional "mistakes."

- People high in self-awareness are remarkably clear in their understanding of what they do well, what motivates and satisfies them, and which people and situations push their buttons.

- The only way to genuinely understand your emotions is to spend enough time thinking through them to figure out where they come from and why they are there.

- **_Relationship management_** is your ability to use your awareness of your own emotions and those of others to manage interactions successfully. This skill often taps into your abilities in the first three emotional intelligence skills: self-awareness, self-management, and social awareness.

- If you want people to listen, you have to practice relationship management and seek benefits from every relationship, especially the challenging ones.

- Middle managers stand out, with the highest EQ scores in the workforce. But up beyond middle management, there is a steep downward trend in EQ scores. For the titles of director and above, scores descend faster than a snowboarder on a black diamond. CEOS, on average, have the lowest EQ in the workplace.

- A full 70% of male leaders who rank in the top 15% in decision-making skills also score the highest in emotional intelligence skills.

- Women out performed men in self-management, social awareness, and relationship management. In fact, self-awareness was the only EQ skill in which men were able to keep pace with women.

- Under stress-free conditions, we can consciously devote extra effort to staying calm and collected during the trials and tribulations of everyday life. We are more confident in our abilities to handle unexpected events, and we allow our minds to overcome troublesome matters. Unmanaged stress, however, consumes much of those mental resources. It reduces our minds to something like a state of martial law in which emotions single-handedly dictate behavior, while our rational capacities are busy trying to turn lemons into lemonade. Suddenly, a little set back in your project at work that would have been no big deal in relatively prosperous times feels more like a catastrophe than a minor nuisance. For many people, their EQ skills desert them at precisely the time when they need these skills the most-under stress. Only those with well-trained and almost second-nature EQ skills can effectively weather the storm.
