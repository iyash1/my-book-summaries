# The Productivity Project

### Chris Bailey

- The most productive people work at a pace somewhere between the monk and the stock trader—fast enough to get everything done, and slowly enough so they can identify what’s important and then work deliberately and with intention.

- When you have more to do than ever before, less time to do it, and unparalleled freedom and flexibility with how you get it done, productivity is no longer about how efficiently you work. Productivity is about how much you accomplish.

- Perhaps most important, if you can’t manage all three—time, attention, energy—well, it is next to impossible to work deliberately and with intention throughout the day.

- I discovered that there is absolutely no difference in socioeconomic standing between someone who is an early riser and someone who is a night owl—we are all wired differently, and one routine is not inherently better than another. It’s what you do with your waking hours, I discovered, that makes the difference in how productive you are

- how important it is to deeply care about why you want to become more productive.

- perhaps the biggest lesson I learned from this experiment was just how important it is to deeply care about your productivity goals, about why you want to become more productive.

- Working deliberately and purposefully throughout the day can make or break how productive you are. But having a purpose is just as important. The intention behind your actions is like the shaft behind an arrowhead—it’s pretty difficult to become more productive day in and day out when you don’t care about what you want to accomplish on a deeper level.

- Questioning why you want to make a change to your life can save you countless hours or even days of time, when you discover that you don’t really want to make the change in the first place.

- But making the jump between knowing and doing is what productivity is all about.

- Not all tasks are created equal; there are certain tasks in your work that, for every minute you spend on them, let you accomplish more than your other tasks. Taking a step back from your work to identify your highest-impact tasks will let you invest your time, attention, and energy in the right things.

- Intention and deliberateness are two sides of the same coin, and I think both are essential if you want to live more productively.

- The more time, energy, and attention you invest in your most significant tasks, the more you accomplish in the same amount of time, and the more productive you become.

- A task, project, or commitment is important for one of two reasons: because it’s meaningful to you (it’s connected with your values) or because it makes a large impact in your work.

- Activities that are connected with your deepest-held values will lead you to be happier and more motivated, and activities that are primary to your work will let you become more productive in the same amount of time.

- The **_Pareto Principle_**, often referred to as the 80-20 rule. The rule says that 80 percent of [some result] comes from 20 percent of [some cause]. For example, 80 percent of your sales come from 20 percent of your customers, or 80 percent of all income is earned by 20 percent of the people.

- The absolute best technique I’ve found to work deliberately and with intention every day is the Rule of 3. The rule is simple: at the beginning of each day, before you start working, decide what three things you want to accomplish by the end of the day. Do the same at the start of every week.

- Having a great system for managing what you need to get done is important, but it’s just as important to work on the tasks you organize in your system deliberately, with intention.

- The rule is dead simple:
  1. At the beginning of every day, mentally fast-forward to the end of the day, and ask yourself: When the day is over, what three things will I want to have accomplished? Write those three things down.
  2. Do the same at the beginning of every week. The three things you identify then become your focus for the day and the week ahead.

> “Simplicity makes it easier to evolve and innovate and deal with complexity.”

- When you take the time to observe how your energy fluctuates over the course of the day, you can work on your highest-impact tasks during your Biological Prime Time—when you are able to bring the most energy and focus to them. In a similar way, tracking how you spend your time over a week will let you see how intelligently you use your time, and how well you focus throughout the day.

- The most productive people don’t just manage their time well, they also manage their energy and attention well. Rearranging your day around when you have the most energy is one simple way to work smarter instead of just harder.

- Research shows that your brain’s prefrontal cortex—the part of your brain responsible for creative thinking—is the most active immediately after you wake up. That means that even if you’re low on energy after you wake up, if you do a lot of creative work, you may want to consider working in the morning instead of when you have the most energy, focus, and motivation. To me, it also feels incredible to tackle your important tasks at the beginning of the day—you’ll feel like you’re unstoppable for the rest of the day.

- You may not have complete control over what you work on and when you work on it, but whenever you do, choosing the smartest time to work on high- and low-impact tasks can make a huge difference in your productivity. For example, if you have the most energy at noon, why would you break for lunch then, instead of waiting until you actually need to refuel?

- Procrastination is human. The biggest reason your highest-impact tasks are so valuable is that they are often more intimidating; they almost always require more time, attention, and energy than your lower-impact tasks. They’re typically also more boring, frustrating, difficult, unstructured, and lacking

- And there are six main task attributes that make procrastination more likely. Those are whether a task is one or more of the following:

  - Boring
  - Frustrating
  - Difficult
  - Unstructured or ambiguous
  - Lacking in personal meaning
  - Lacking in intrinsic rewards (i.e., it’s not fun or engaging)

- Procrastination gets in the way of accomplishing more since it is, in its simplest form, a gap between your intention and action.

- Your limbic system is the emotional, instinctual part of your brain that includes, among other things, your pleasure center. Evolutionarily speaking, the limbic is an old part of your brain—like an animal, it’s what makes you instinctual and pushes you to give in to emotions and temptations. This is the part of your brain that tries to tempt you to put off doing your taxes to watch a few episodes of House of Cards. Your prefrontal cortex is the logical part of your brain that’s fighting to get you to do your taxes. It’s responsible for, among other things, logic, reason, and keeping your longer-term goals in mind.

- In the exact same way that the most productive people learn to step back from working on autopilot, the most productive people learn to use their prefrontal cortexes more than their limbic systems.

- Flipping a task’s triggers tackles two birds with one stone: it simultaneously makes a task less aversive by disabling its procrastination triggers, while it readies your prefrontal cortex to battle your brain’s limbic system.

- “The dread of doing a task uses up more time and energy than doing the task itself.”

- The more disconnected you are from your future self, the more likely you are to do things like: Give your future self more work than you would give your present self Agree to unproductive or pointless meetings far off in the future Keep ten uninspiring documentaries around on your PVR that you’ll “get around to watching” Continually transfer aversive tasks to tomorrow’s to-do list Save less money for retirement

- In the Rule of 3, your future self takes center stage. By mentally fast-forwarding to the end of the day and thinking about what you want to accomplish, you activate the planning centers in your prefrontal cortex, while you also step into the shoes of your future self. And you do the same when you plan out your three accomplishments at the start of every week.

- The internet can absolutely obliterate your productivity if you’re not careful.

- While the internet is fun and stimulating, it will almost always try to tempt you away from working on the highest-impact tasks

- the internet is basically the world’s largest candy store for your limbic system. With every tap and click, your limbic system receives a steady stream of stimulation.

- Disconnecting not only lets you reclaim the time (and attention) you waste mindlessly, it also makes it easier to focus on your higher-impact tasks.

- Research shows that of all the character traits we have, impulsiveness is the one that is most highly correlated with procrastination. The more impulsive you are, the more you procrastinate, because your limbic system is that much stronger than your prefrontal cortex.

- Time—disconnect, and observe how much work you get done. After you observe how much work you get done when you disconnect, my guess is you’ll use this strategy a ton. You may even be tempted to implement a nightly shutoff ritual.

- If you want to become more productive, managing your time should take a backseat to how you manage your energy and attention.

> Managing your time becomes important only after you understand how much energy and focus you will have throughout the day and define what you want to accomplish.

> By controlling how much time you spend on a task, you control how much energy and attention you spend on it.

> Productivity is an elusive idea; because it’s hard to get a handle on just how much you accomplish every day, looking at how busy you are is a quick, down and dirty, and usually inaccurate shortcut to seeing how productive you are.

> Learn to invest more energy and attention into your work, so you can get the same amount done in a fraction of the time.

- Shrinking how long you’ll work on the task is also a great way to warm up to difficult tasks that you are more likely to procrastinate on.

- Shrinking a task works wonders every time—and the hack is helpful for forming new daily habits, too. Plus, once you get started, chances are you’ll want to keep going beyond your original point of resistance.

- Working ninety hours a week for any longer than one week is a recipe for burnout. Doing so leaves you with hardly any time to recharge your energy levels and focus. Just as you can work too few hours, you can also simply work too much.

- But studies show that after roughly thirty-five or forty hours, your productivity begins to plummet.

- Consistently working for more than thirty-five or forty hours a week makes you less productive over time, because it leads you to make more mistakes and poorer decisions, both of which can take a lot of time to fix. It also causes you to miss new ideas, opportunities, shortcuts, and opportunities to work smarter instead of just harder.

- To work more deliberately, awareness is key. It’s essential that you become aware of your energy levels so you can spend your energy wisely throughout the day.

- On days when I find myself having more or less energy than I usually do, I simply write out how much energy (on a scale of 1–10) each of my three daily tasks will take. This makes it easier to adapt what I’m working on to the amount of energy and focus I have at the moment.

- Managing your time becomes important only after you define what you want to accomplish and understand how much energy and focus you have throughout the day.

- Asking yourself whether you’re a maker or manager will show you your baseline; that is, the amount of structure that you should come to expect based on the nature of your job. You may fall somewhere in between;

- Regardless of whether you’re a maker or manager, some structure is essential. Structure helps you accommodate for your BPT, guides you to work on what you intend to accomplish, and helps you nurture your attention and your energy so you can run on a full tank throughout the day. But beyond accounting for your prime time, intentions, and nature of your job, any additional structure will tend to make your day more rigid and will make you feel less in control of your day. And the more structure you have, the more difficult it becomes to adapt to how you work throughout the day.

- Gathering your maintenance tasks together and tackling them all at once is the perfect antidote to being a perfectionist about the wrong things. Nonetheless, maintenance tasks, or Maintenance Days, are essential if you want to have a life that’s healthy and productive.

- **_Maintenance Day._** My Maintenance Day ritual is incredibly simple, and incredibly powerful: throughout the week, I simply collect all of my low-return maintenance tasks on a list—everything from going grocery shopping to cutting my nails—and instead of doing them throughout the week, I do them all at

- My Maintenance Day ritual is incredibly simple, and incredibly powerful: throughout the week, I simply collect all of my low-return maintenance tasks on a list—everything from going grocery shopping to cutting my nails—and instead of doing them throughout the week, I do them all at once.

- Try setting a time limit for how long you’ll work on your maintenance tasks, to get more done in less time. Just make sure you don’t work on them during your BPT—that time is sacred.

- Having a Maintenance Day helps you eliminate both physical and mental clutter, so you can approach each new week with more clarity and energy. Plus, it feels freaking amazing to accomplish ten or fifteen things at once, and check them off your to-do list.

- Simplifying and creating more space around your high-return tasks gives you the wiggle room to react and then deal with whatever unexpected task comes along.

- By creating more space between your high-return tasks and commitments, you can immerse yourself in them more completely, work smarter, and give them the time and attention they deserve.

- Every single support task in your work can be either shrunk, delegated, or even, in a few rare cases, eliminated entirely. After you have a better grip on how much time and attention you spend on your problem tasks, the maintenance tasks in your work are a lot easier to deal with.

- **_Parkinson’s law_** states that your work expands to fit the amount of time you have available for it.

- Your limbic system puts up such a fight against working on your more challenging, highest-return tasks, the low-impact tasks that support your work almost serve as work “crack” or work candy.

- Just as a Maintenance Day creates structure around the support tasks in your life, setting limits for support tasks in your work makes it much harder for them to expand and take up more of your time or attention than they need to.

- The word no is a powerful tool in your productivity tool kit. While time is no longer money in the knowledge economy, money can buy you time when you spend it intelligently. For every low-impact task, project, and commitment you say no to, you say yes to working on your most valuable tasks.

- Buying back time isn’t about doing less; it’s about working smarter to do more of the things you find meaningful.

- While it’s one thing to eliminate, shrink, and delegate the tasks and commitments you already have, the number of tasks and commitments you take on is not static. It fluctuates over time. If you don’t continually defend your time and attention against low-return tasks, projects, and commitments, your life can easily become flooded with low-return activities.

- The 90 percent rule is simple: when you look at a new opportunity, rank it on a scale of 1-100 on how valuable or meaningful you think it is. If it isn’t a 90 or above, don’t do it.

- “your job isn’t stuffing it all in; siphoning your energy into lots of good things. Your energy is best spent on the greatest things.” Your energy is for working on what’s most important—and most essential.

- For every low-impact task, project, and commitment you say no to, you can say yes to working on your most valuable tasks.

- A particularly powerful way to identify your commitments and obligations is to look at your low-impact tasks, and then think about which commitments they belong to. Every task or project you have stems from a larger commitment. By actively thinking about what commitment each task or project is affiliated with, you can identify the highest- and lowest-return commitments in your life relatively easily. Not every low-return task or project is part of a low-return commitment, but many of them will be.

- The most productive people take the time to not only understand what’s important, but also to simplify everything else.

- Externalizing your tasks and writing them down is a powerful way to free up mental space and get organized. Performing a “brain dump” not only reduces stress and helps you focus, it also motivates you to action.

- Doing a weekly review of your tasks and accomplishments not only gives you a better perspective on your wins and the areas you need to improve, it also gives you more control over your life. Adding in “hot spots” is a powerful addition to this technique that will keep you on the right path.

- We have seven areas in which we invest our time (and attention and energy) every day:

  1. Mind
  2. Body
  3. Emotions
  4. Career
  5. Finances
  6. Relationships
  7. Fun
  8. Ninety percent of the people I’ve met fit their commitments into these seven life areas.

- Letting your mind wander without distraction, such as when you’re in the shower, is beneficial for brainstorming, problem solving, and becoming more creative.

- Our minds never stop thinking. Even when we focus on something with our complete attention, our brain continues, like a computer, to have windows open in the background. And if a problem is particularly complex or requires a creative solution, our subconscious minds may even do a better job—especially when we give ourselves more attentional space to work on it.

- Research shows we only focus on what’s in front of us 53 percent of the time. Developing a strong “attention muscle” is what makes it possible to focus more on the task at hand, which lets us spend our time and attention more efficiently in the moment.

- Productivity isn’t about doing more, faster—it’s about doing the right things, deliberately and with intention. This is why carving out more time and attentional space around your tasks is so powerful: doing so gives you the room to work on higher-return tasks in the moment, fend off low-return tasks, and become more productive.

- According to neuroscientists, our attention is made up of three parts:

  1. _Your Central Executive_: This is your thinking and planning brain that lives in your prefrontal cortex. So far, particularly in the procrastination section, I’ve done my best to write this book in a way that will fire up this part of your brain. It’s mostly the other two parts of your attention muscle that I’ll focus on in this section.
  2. _Focus_: This involves narrowing your attentional spotlight to focus on the task at hand, which helps you work more efficiently.
  3. _Awareness_: This means becoming aware of what’s going on in your internal and external environments, which helps you work more mindfully and deliberately. These three parts combine to make up your larger attention muscle. Training your attention muscle involves building up all three.

- Dealing with distractions before they happen, like by shutting off alerts on your phone for new messages, helps you avoid attention-hijacking interruptions. It can take as many as twenty-five minutes to refocus on the task at hand after being interrupted.

- But there’s an equally large cost to being constantly stimulated and distracted: it affects your memory. When you repeatedly move your attentional spotlight from one thing to another, your brain gets overloaded. And when your brain is overloaded, it shifts its processing from your hippocampus (responsible for memory) to the area of your brain responsible for rote tasks, making it difficult to learn a new task or recall what you were doing before you were interrupted.

- From the moment we wake up to the time we go to bed, we are plugged in; connected to a steady stream of attention hijackers that derail our focus, weaken our attention muscle, and cause us to remember less. Protecting your memory is yet another reason to disable as many attention hijackers in your work as possible.

- Single tasking is one of the best ways to tame a wandering mind, because it helps you build up your “attention muscle” and carve out more attentional space around the task you are tackling in the moment. It is also a powerful tool for improving your memory. Just as working out in the gym builds the muscles in your body, continually drawing your attention back to your chosen task has been shown to build your attention muscle.

> Busyness is no different from laziness when it doesn’t lead you to accomplish anything.

> Productivity isn’t about how busy or efficient you are—it’s about how much you accomplish.

> Just because you feel productive doesn’t mean you are—and the opposite is often true.

- Work is simply more fun and stimulating when you multitask—even though when you multitask you invariably accomplish less.

- Every habit was made up of three simple parts: a cue, routine, and a reward. “There’s the cue, which is the trigger for an automatic behavior to start, and then the routine, which is the behavior itself, and then finally a reward.”

- Cues that trigger habits fall into one of five categories: a specific time of day, a place, a feeling, the presence of certain people, or a preceding behavior that you have ritualized. This is why creating a productive daily routine is so powerful: you do the same thing every day, and when you ensure that your routine is genuinely rewarding to you, over time you solidify the neurological pathways in your brain until it becomes an automatic habit.

- Studies show that your brain releases steady hits of dopamine when you work on more than one thing at once. Neurochemically speaking, your brain rewards you more when you multitask, compared to when you do just one thing at a time.

- Multitasking makes you less productive because it makes you more prone to errors, adds stress to your work, takes longer because it costs you time and attention to switch between tasks, and even affects your memory; much like being bombarded with interruptions and distractions, multitasking overloads your brain.

- Multitasking even makes you more prone to experiencing boredom, anxiety, and depression.

- Every time you bring your attention back to a single task, you reinforce that habit, which gradually becomes stronger over time—particularly when you consciously fend off distractions and interruptions in the first place.

- The key to all these tactics is to constantly bring your attention back to the task at hand when it wanders off. Every time you reengage your wandering mind with the task at hand, your attention muscle becomes that much stronger, and you’ll heighten the amount of control you have over your mind so you can prevent it from wandering off in the future.

- Single tasking is one of the best ways to tame a wandering mind and carve out more attentional space around your tasks in the moment—the final step to working deliberately and with intention.

- Practicing mind-fulness and meditation makes you more productive because it makes your mind calmer, happier, and more focused. Meditation is also far less intimidating than you imagine.

- Mindfulness is important because we value things differently in the moment than we do in the long term, and mindfulness gives us the attentional space we need to switch off autopilot and make more productive decisions in the moment. When we work automatically and lean too much on our habits, we have less attentional space for our prefrontal cortex to intervene to make the most productive decision. Mindfulness lets us carve out more attentional space in the moment to work smarter and more deliberately.

- Meditation helps you focus better, waste less time, work more intentionally, and also makes it easier to identify high-return tasks and, over time, resist your brain’s limbic system. Focus and awareness are two of the largest parts of your attention muscle—and there is no better way to work them out than to single-task and meditate.

- The power of incremental improvements lies in the fact that although they’re not significant by themselves, week after week, month after month, they add up to produce results in the long term that will blow you away. Small changes lead to big results, especially when food is involved.

- Your brain cells consume double the energy that the other cells in your body consume; even though your brain makes up just 2–3 percent of your body mass, it burns 20 percent of the calories you take in.

- Like with interest at the bank, as you begin to make incremental improvements with every hot spot that makes up the portfolio of your life, your habits will compound and pay incredible dividends with time.\* And best of all, they’ll actually stick.

- On a neurological level, you have mental energy when you have glucose in your brain. When you feel tired or fatigued, more often than not it’s either because your brain has too much or not enough glucose to convert into mental energy. Research has shown that the optimal amount of glucose to have in your bloodstream is around 25 grams—about the amount of glucose in a banana.

- Luckily, what is good for your brain is good for your body. To drink for energy, drink fewer alcoholic and sugary drinks, drink more water (which is incredible for your brain health), and learn to drink caffeine strategically, when you’ll actually benefit from the energy boost—not habitually.

- Every day the average person consumes a whopping 356 calories through what he or she drinks—and 44 percent of those calories come from sugary drinks that give the consumer a huge glucose rush and then crash afterward.

- Something is considered a “drug” when it has a physiological effect on your body, and caffeine and alcohol are no exception to this rule. As an example, both boost how much dopamine—a main pleasure chemical in your brain—the neural pathways in your brain produce, essentially rewarding you for consuming caffeine and alcohol. (Dopamine isn’t entirely a bad thing, and it would be hard to become motivated without it, but it does make certain substances more rewarding than others.)

- Just as drinking alcohol is a way of borrowing energy from tomorrow, drinking caffeine is a way of borrowing energy from later in the day.

- There is a chemical in your body and brain called “adenosine,” which tells your brain when it’s tired. Caffeine prevents your brain from absorbing this chemical, which prevents your brain from knowing it’s tired. But here’s the thing: while caffeine blocks your brain from absorbing adenosine, the chemical continues to build up until caffeine eventually lets your brain absorb it again. Your body and brain then absorb a whole whack of this tired chemical at once, which causes your energy levels to plummet.

- In addition to drinking caffeine at more strategic times, here are a few suggestions for drinking caffeine strategically in general:

  1. Don’t drink any sugary or alcoholic caffeinated drinks. They’ll only cause you to crash quicker and harder.
  2. Be careful about drinking caffeine before working on a creative task, because caffeine has been shown to hurt your performance with tasks that involve creativity.
  3. Be mindful that you don’t consume caffeine less than eight to fourteen hours before bed, so it doesn’t affect your sleep.
  4. If it makes sense for your productivity, consume caffeine between 9:30 and 11:30 a.m. (if you wake up between 6 and 8 a.m.). This is when caffeine will have the greatest impact on your energy levels, because you naturally have less energy then, when your cortisol levels are lower. Caffeine also has a bigger effect between 1:30 and 5:30 p.m., but because it needs eight to fourteen hours to leave your system, it’s likely not worth the impact it will have on your sleep.
  5. Find a better caffeine delivery system, like green tea or matcha. Green tea and matcha are my favorite caffeine vehicles, because they’re chock-full of antioxidants and L-theanine, which ease the caffeine crash afterward. Matcha is a tad more expensive than tea and coffee, but I think it’s well worth the price; for a few extra bucks you essentially buy back some energy that you will be able to use later in the day. When you consider how your energy levels can have such a huge impact on how much you accomplish, it’s often worth the extra cost.
  6. Use an energy crash strategically. I often like to drink a big cup of coffee twelve hours before an overnight flight, so I crash just in time to sleep all the way through the flight. And when I travel overseas, I like to drink coffee a few hours after I wake up so I have a ton of energy throughout the day, and crash in time for my new bedtime.

- Caffeine has been shown to make introverts perform poorer on tasks that are quantitative and done under time pressure, whereas it has been found to have the opposite effect for extroverts. This is because introverts are more stimulated by their environment by default, and that extra caffeine can push them over the edge. As an ambivert I fall somewhere in between (maybe even a little on the introverted side) and have found that a moderate amount of caffeine positively impacts my performance in nearly all situations.

- One study found that drinking water first thing in the morning fires up your metabolism, making it 24 percent faster. (Plus, you’re usually dehydrated when you wake up, because you just went eight hours without drinking anything.) Another discovered that participants who drank a glass of water before every meal lost 4.5 pounds over three months. Why? Because water partly fills your stomach before you eat and acts as a calorie-free appetite suppressant. Water also helps you think more clearly (your brain tissue is made up of 75% water), clears up your complexion, and significantly reduces your risk of many diseases and ailments. Drinking more water will even save you money.

- Much of the reason why it’s so difficult to be productive today has to do with the fact that the working world has evolved much faster than our brain. We procrastinate because our prefrontal cortex hasn’t evolved to become stronger than our limbic system, which is seduced by the unproductive tasks in our work.

- When you start to exercise—and this is especially the case with aerobic exercise—your brain sees it as a fight-or-flight situation, which causes your brain to release a concoction of chemicals that prepare you to fight the treadmill. These chemicals have a ton of neurological benefits, especially as far as stress relief is concerned. Biochemically speaking, exercise allows your brain to fight stress in a productive and controlled way.

- Exercise increases how much blood flows to your brain, which increases your mental performance and creativity. It combats fatigue, in addition to stress, and helps you bring more focus to your work. And studies show that in addition to bulking up your muscles, exercise quite literally bulks up your brain. When you exercise, your brain releases BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), a chemical that helps you create new brain cells. A lot of this growth happens in the hippocampus—the part of your brain responsible for memory. Exercise has even been shown to boost your mood and build cells in brain regions damaged by depression.

- Exercise is worth your time and is one of the best things you can do to become more productive. The more active you are, the more energy you’ll have to burn.

- Although cutting back on sleep saves you time, any amount of sleep you lose below the amount your body requires is not worth the productivity cost. For every hour of sleep you miss out on, you lose at least two hours of productivity—the costs associated with not getting enough sleep are that great.

- Although the connection between nutrition and exercise and productivity is complex, the connection between productivity and sleep is simple. Sleep is a way of exchanging your time for energy. The more sleep you get, up to the recommended seven to nine hours, the more energy you’ll have the next day. And the exchange rate is pretty damn good.

- woke up didn’t matter one bit. What mattered was what time I went to bed, and that was the thing I had to chip away at. This is something important to keep in mind when it comes to getting enough sleep. The key to getting enough sleep isn’t to sleep in. Not many people have the luxury of being able to wake up whenever they want, and though it would be nice if we were all entrepreneurs who had control over our schedules, most of us have a relatively set routine of arriving at work. What we do have control over is what time we head to bed. To get enough sleep, going to bed at the right time is the key. It took another two months to work at my nighttime routine and integrate the habit into my life, but after I finally realized that trying to force the routine into my life wasn’t working, I made a plan to make enough incremental improvements to my routine to solidify an early-morning wake-up ritual. Setting aside the fact that I wasn’t programmed to be an early riser, these will work for you regardless of when you’re built to wake up, since they all revolve around getting to bed at a decent time. Here’s what I found worked better than anything else: Create a nighttime ritual. If your target bedtime is 9 p.m., like mine was, it’s pretty hard to force yourself to start getting ready for bed at 8:45 when you’re in the middle of something. Creating a nighttime ritual will help you plan and become more deliberate about getting a good night’s sleep. I recommend picking a very specific time to head to bed and planning out when you’ll start your ritual to ease out of the day.

> To get enough sleep, going to bed at the right time is the key.

- Creating a nighttime ritual will help you plan and become more deliberate about getting a good night’s sleep. I recommend picking a very specific time to head to bed and planning out when you’ll start your ritual to ease out of the day.

> Light that sits in the blue wavelength has been proven to inhibit melatonin production, a chemical in your body and brain that helps you sleep.

- Like sleep, napping has been shown to boost your focus, accuracy, creativity, decision-making skills, and ultimately your productivity. For the amount of time it takes you to walk to the coffee shop and back, you can get the same energy boost with a nap, without the crash afterward.

> Stop drinking caffeine eight to fourteen hours before you sleep.

> “thinking of a bedroom as a cave: It should be cool, quiet, and dark.”

- Studies show that what time you wake up has no impact whatsoever on your socioeconomic standing, cognitive performance, or health. As far as your productivity is concerned, it’s what you do with your time after you wake up, and whether you got enough sleep in the first place, that makes the difference.

- Investing in your productivity is a worthwhile goal, but life is too short to not be kind to yourself in the process.

> Research shows that productivity and happiness are in sync.

> Happier people are 31 percent more productive, have 37 percent better sales figures, have better, more secure jobs, are also better at keeping their jobs, are more resilient, and have less burnout.

> If you care about productivity, being kind to yourself is crucial.
