# Mind is your Business

### Sadhguru

- If we have to experience the circus of the mind as a miraculously coordinated activity rather than as a mess, the most important and crucial thing is that your intellect is not identified with anything. There is no other way.

- once your intellect identifies with something or the other, it gets chained with the identifications. Once this happens, you have a completely distorted experience of the mind.

- Only when you get dis-identified, when you are able to be involved but not entangled, only then it can stop.

- Having an aversion to something and an attraction towards something else is the basis of identification. Whatever you are averse to dominates your mind. The nature of your mind is such that if you say, “I do not want something,” only that thing keeps happening in your mind. There is no subtraction or division in the mind, there is only addition and multiplication. You cannot take away anything by force from the mind. This does not need any enlightenment to be understood.

- It is the identification which is causing entanglement, not the involvement. If your involvement is beyond your identifications, you will see that involvement brings absolute joy to life.

- Yes, there are many ways to make minor corrections and make yourself a little more effective than before, but if you really want to unleash the mind – not control the mind – if you truly want to unleash the power of the mind, the fundamental thing is, your intellect should not be identified with anything. Then your perception comes to such clarity that the mind naturally organizes itself, no one has to organize the mind. Only because the perception is so distorted, its function and its outcome are also distorted.

- If thoughts are going on continuously, if you are having mental diarrhea, you obviously ate some bad food. You have physical diarrhea because you eat bad food. If you have mental diarrhea, you obviously consumed something wrong. The moment you identify yourself with something that you are not, you are finished – your mind is in a continuous run. There is no other way. Do what you want, try as hard as you want, it is not going to stop. But if you take away these identities, if you simply sit here as a piece of life – not as a man or a woman, not as a Hindu or a Christian, not as an Indian or an American, not as anything – simply as a piece of life, you will see, the mind will become still. Now, when you want to think, you can think, but if you don’t want to think, you don’t think. That is how it should be.

- The mind will not say, “I won’t do it.” If your mind says, “I won’t do it,” your ego will say, “I will do it.” That is the nature of your ego. If I want to get something done by you, one simple way of getting it done is to say “Please don’t do it. No, you should not do it. Don’t do it.” You will do it because that is the nature of the ego. So the mind will never say, “I will not do it.” It will say, “Let’s do it tomorrow” – and tomorrow never comes.

- the mind knows that if you keep the body still, the mind will also naturally become still. And the mind knows that if it allows this to happen, it will become enslaved. This is why in yoga, so much stress has been laid on asanas, because if you just learn how to keep your body absolutely still, then your mind will also become still.

- Truth is that dimension which is not logically explainable. It does not fit into logic because logic is always dividing; truth is always unifying. So where will this logic fit into life?

- If you think hundred percent logically, there is really no possibility of life. Only if you know to what extent your logic should go and where it should not go, your life will be beautiful. If you become absolutely logical, there is no beauty to your life. Everything becomes bare and no good.

- Your old stock of karma is not the problem at all. You should learn how not to create new stock. That is the main thing. Old stock will wear out by itself; no big things need to be done about it. But the fundamental thing is you learn how not to create new stock. Then, leaving the old stock is very simple.

- But Patanjali nailed it this way –

  > “To rise above the modifications of your mind, when you cease your mind, when you cease to be a part of your mind, that is yoga.”

- All the influences of the world are entering you only through the instrument of the mind. If you can rise beyond the influence of your mind in full awareness, then you are naturally one with everything. The separation – you and me, time and space – has come only because of the mind. It is a bondage of the mind. If you drop the mind, you have dropped time and space. There is no such thing as this and that. There is no such thing as here and there. There is no such thing as now and then. Everything is here and now.

- Energy, or prana, flows through the body in certain established patterns; it is not moving randomly. There are 72,000 different ways in which it moves. In other words, there are 72,000 pathways in the system through which it is flowing. So nadis are pathways or channels in the system. They do not have a physical manifestation; if you cut the body and look inside, you will not find these nadis. But as you become more and more aware, you will notice the energy is not moving at random, it is moving in established pathways. When you utter the sound “Aaa,” you will see the reverberation will start about three-fourths of an inch below the navel and spread right across the body. Sound “Aaa” is the only reverberation which spreads right across the body because this is the only place where the 72,000 nadis meet and redistribute themselves. They all meet at Manipuraka and redistribute themselves. This is the only point in the body like that. If you utter the sound “Aaa,” the reverberations of this sound are carried right across the system. This reverberation can assist greatly in energizing your maintenance center. Activating this center will bring health, dynamism, prosperity and wellbeing.
