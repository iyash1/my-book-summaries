# The New One Minute Manager

- The most effective managers manage themselves and the people they work with so that both the people and the organization profit from their presence.

- “Since speed is a currency of success now, leading with collaboration is far more effective than the old command-and-control system.”

` To succeed sooner, managers must be both results-oriented and people-oriented.`

` People Who Feel Good About Themselves Produce Good Results.`

> “Helping people feel good about themselves is a key to productivity.”

- Remember—productivity is more than just the quantity of work done. It is also the quality.

- Without giving people a quality product and the service they want, you won’t stay in business for long.

- A goal and its performance standard—what needs to be done and by what due date—should take no more than a paragraph or two to express, so it can be read and reviewed in about a minute.

- A problem only exists if there is a difference between what is actually happening and what you desire to be happening.

> ## One Minute Goals: Summary
>
> - ONE MINUTE GOALS WORK WELL WHEN YOU:
>
>   1.  Plan the goals together and describe them briefly and clearly. Show people what good performance looks like.
>   2.  Have people write out each of their goals, with due dates, on a single page.
>   3.  Ask them to review their most important goals each day, which takes only a few minutes to do.
>   4.  Encourage people to take a minute to look at what they’re doing, and see if their behavior matches their goals.
>   5.  If it doesn’t, encourage them to re-think what they’re doing so they can realize their goals sooner.

`How can you be an effective manager unless you and your team are clear about goals and what good performance looks like?`

`Help People Reach Their Full Potential. Catch Them Doing Something Right.`

- “Because confidence that is earned helps you deal with all the changes that are occurring. We’re expected to be confident enough to innovate in order to stay ahead.”

> ## One Minute Praisings: Summary
>
> - A ONE MINUTE PRAISING WORKS WELL WHEN YOU:
>   - THE FIRST HALF-MINUTE
>     1. Praise people as soon as possible.
>     2. Let people know what they did right—be specific.
>     3. Tell people how good you feel about what they did right, and how it helps. PAUSE
>     4. Pause for a moment to allow people time to feel good about what they’ve done.
>   - THE SECOND HALF-MINUTE
>     1. Encourage them to do more of the same.
>     2. Make it clear you have confidence in them and support their success.

- Praising people doesn’t always work if it isn’t combined with Re-Directs to correct mistakes when they occur.

- Goals make clear what is most important to focus on, Praisings build confidence that helps you succeed, and Re-Directs address mistakes. And all three of these help people feel better about themselves and produce good results.

> ## One Minute Re-Directs: Summary
>
> - IF THE GOAL IS CLEAR, A ONE MINUTE RE-DIRECT WORKS WELL WHEN YOU:
>   - THE FIRST HALF-MINUTE
>     1. Re-Direct people as soon as possible.
>     2. Confirm the facts first, and review the mistake together—be specific.
>     3. Express how you feel about the mistake and its impact on results. PAUSE
>     4. Be quiet for a moment to allow people time to feel concerned about what they’ve done.
>   - THE SECOND HALF-MINUTE
>     1.  Remember to let them know that they’re better than their mistake, and that you think well of them as a person.
>     2.  Remind them that you have confidence and trust in them, and support their success.

> The Best Minute I Spend Is The One I Invest In People.

- Most companies spend more time and money on maintaining their buildings, technology, and equipment than they do on developing people.”

- Many managers assume wrongly that the people on their team know what to aim for.

- The number one motivator of people is feedback on results. They want to know how they’re doing.

> Everyone Is A Potential Winner. Some People Are Disguised As Losers. Don’t Let Their Appearances Fool You.

- Take a Minute To Look At Your Goals. Then Look At What You’re Doing And See If It Matches Your Goals.

- “At work, and in life, too, you don’t have to catch a winner doing things right very often, because good performers catch themselves doing things right. But people who are learning benefit from praise and encouragement from others.”

- Punishment doesn’t work when you use it with someone who’s learning.

- “Rather than punish inexperienced people who are still learning, we need to re-direct them. That involves resetting clear One Minute Goals to make sure they understand what’s expected of them and what good performance looks like.”

- “If managers would address things earlier, they could deal with one behavior at a time and the person would not be overwhelmed. They’d be more likely to hear the feedback the way it was intended. That’s why I think performance review should be an ongoing process, not something you do only once a year.”

- When our self-concept is under attack, we feel a need to defend ourselves and our actions, even to the extent of distorting the facts. When people become defensive, they don’t learn.

- If you are first tough on the behavior, and then supportive of the person, it works better.

- It is very important when you are leading people to remember that behavior and worth are not the same things. What is really worthwhile is the person who’s managing their own behavior.

> We Are Not Just Our Behavior. We Are The Person Managing Our Behavior.

- You’ll be more successful when you respect the individual you’re re-directing.

- Your job is to show people how to manage themselves and enjoy it. You want them to succeed when you’re not around.

- You have to care enough to be tough—that is, tough on the poor performance but not on the person.

- “A One Minute Re-Direct is intended to help people learn. However, when a person has learned something and has shown they can do it, but they have a won’t do attitude, you need to look at the cost to the organization, and whether you can afford to keep such a person on the team.”

> Goals Begin Behaviors. Consequences Influence Future Behaviors.

- Deep down, people like to work for themselves.
