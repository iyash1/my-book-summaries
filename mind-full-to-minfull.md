# Mind Full to Mindful: Zen Wisdom From a Monk's Bowl

### Om Swami

---

- ### **Awakening**

  - Essentially, that is what Zen is about: a state free of conditioning so that the mind can rest and rejoice, so it may go with the flow of life without the anxiety to always get somewhere. Life is here. Now. Though it is easier said than done, it is possible.
    This is awakening in a nutshell: to have a graceful response to everything life throws at you without losing your sense of serenity and inner calm.

  - Being kind to ourselves as well as travelling on a spiritual path can go hand-in-hand. For the next few months, he started eating proper meals.

- ### **Enlightened Living**

  - Maintaining awareness of the present moment requires doing one thing at a time so as to focus on your chief activity. Multitasking is the nemesis of mindfulness.

  - Zen is having your mind in tune with your intentions, actions and speech.

- ### **The First Zen Transformation**

  - When your mind blooms, the whole world is in spring. When it experiences autumn, no matter how much beauty there is in the external world, all feels lacklustre. Everything is doomed and in gloom. Therefore, Zen says, let me simply focus on my mind. Because if I keep my mind in a state of bloom, the world is automatically beautiful.

  - Zen says, just let me be in the present moment, that even breathing is a blessing. If I can’t be happy with what I have now, I can never be happy with whatever I may have in the future.

  - If you can’t become one with yourself using any given path, there is no ‘next step’ that will ever get you there. There are stages in meditation, not steps, but you don’t get to those stages by doing different things. You don’t experience those stages by going further. In fact, they are more like states than stages.

  - You just do what you do. You keep perfecting it; you keep championing it and then you reach that stage.

- ### **The Legend Of Bodhidharma**

  - If you do a spiritual act with an expectation,’ Bodhidharma replied,’ it becomes worldly. It becomes a material act. It may no longer be noble or spiritual.

  - Meditation is about silence and stillness. That’s all. Everything else is just noise in every sense of the word.

  - For if I’m doing anything in my life out of choice, there’s no reason to complain and if I don’t have a choice then there’s no sense in complaining.

  - With meditation, the pace of things change. It’s as if you have discovered a method to the madness around you. Your appetite decreases, along with your anger and aggression. You eat less, but are more nourished. You even age slower. This is what mindful living does to you. You use fewer words and you express yourself more effectively. With fewer words, your chances of hurting others lessens too.

- ### **Life is a Flower**

  > **EXERCISE 1 : _Gratitude_**
  >
  > The exercise is very simple. Keep a fresh flower on your car’s dashboard when you drive to work in the morning or when you drive back in the evening. Just keep that flower or another one at your work desk or with you. Whenever you feel low, sad or depressed – which can be a daily occurrence in most of our lives – just look at the flower. Remind yourself this: my life is a flower. I am a flower myself. That this is a blessing.

  - Whatever I have now, if I don’t take care of it or value it, if I am not grateful for it, it will be taken away from me. This is the unfailing law of the universe. If you don’t value what you have, one day you will lose access to that thing. Caring for something is valuing it.

  > **EXERCISE 2 : _Gratitude_**
  >
  > Additionally, maybe the screen saver on your phone could be just these two scribbles: ‘Be grateful, be mindful’. Or it could be the wallpaper on your computer. Perhaps you could replace what you have with something more apt; something that reminds you to be mindful. And maybe next to the names of people in your phone book who give you grief, you could just write, ‘Smile, smile, xyz calling…etc.

  - The more you have to deal with, the more energy you discover in you.

  - If you are fragrant enough, you will automatically attract all creatures that need that fragrance. Show no desperation in love or in life if you value yourself.

  - If you stay true to your dharma, you will automatically attract the right things; the right situations in life. And none of that is possible in a mindless life or in a rash lifestyle. You can do any or all of this only if you are mindful, gentle and tender – when you are very Zen-like, when you are a flower.

- ### **Your First Step in Zen**

  - The art of sitting meditation where you sit down in a comfortable posture and maintain a sense of quietude is called Zazen.

  - In Zazen you don’t try to build your concentration but simply maintain your centre of awareness.

  - Further, in Zazen you never close your eyes. Meditative living ought to be a part of your world, that you see with your eyes.

  > **EXERCISE 3 : _Zazen / Zen Meditation_**
  >
  > 1. In Zen, you sit cross-legged: half or fully cross-legged. That’s the first element. Your back is straight, not stiff, and your neck slightly bent. Your gaze is normal and straight. You keep your eyes open; at the most your eyelids may be halfclosed.
  >
  > 2. Your teeth are slightly parted, barely touching each other. Your tongue is touching your palate and your lips are gently joined. Hold a soft smile.
  >
  > 3. Your elbows should be in their natural posture, each forming an ‘L’.
  >
  > 4. If your back is stooped, you are more likely to doze off than meditate. You will lose awareness. Your concentration and mindfulness will diminish if you bend your back and relax. You can also do that kind of meditation because Zen allows for that. But Zazen is not just sitting in any posture. It is when you sit in a proper posture.
  >
  > 5. We are simply here in the present moment, without thinking at all because even visualization is a form of thinking.
  >
  > 6. Merely count your breath. For instance, I am breathing in one, breathing out one.
  >
  > 7. When you forget how to breathe that you lose control of yourself. When you are angry or aggressive, you breathing is shallow; you breathe hard. When you are calm, you breathe deep and slow. If you regulate your breathing, your mind will become regulated, and as you regulate your mind, your breathing will reflect it.

  - Just as you should never eat to your full satisfaction, only hold your breath so that when you begin your exhalation, it’s done very gently. We must never let go of gentleness.

- ### **Wall Gazing**

  - The moment you make everything a ‘have to’, you’ll feel stressed about it.

  - Missing your practice shouldn’t become the norm. It’s just that sometimes if you do miss it, there’s no point in feeling guilty.

  - Wall gazing gives you the ability to recognize patterns everywhere around you.

  - You can also use that stone as a reminder. Whenever you are angry or down, put your hand in your pocket, press that stone a little and remind yourself, ‘I am supposed to be mindful’.

  - To attain perfection, it’s not the big things but always the minute ones that make a difference. At least, that’s been my experience.

  - You can’t be in a still body unless you have a still mind and vice versa.

- ### **The Zen Tea Ritual (Chado)**

  - The enormous, almost compulsive pressure most people feel to constantly reply to messages night and day is detrimental to their emotional health. Just have an offline time, maybe half an hour, an hour, two hours – whatever you can do – when you are not contactable.

  - > **EXERCISE 4: _Chado_**
    >
    > The Zen tea ritual is practiced in almost all the Zen monasteries, worldwide. The idea is that you drink your tea mindfully, preparing it with joy and serenity, taking in the aroma, the taste and then savouring it, sip by sip. You drink so deliberately and so naturally, that you experience the tea touching your tongue and then your palate, then going down your esophagus and into your belly.

  - But five minutes in each day, give to yourself. If you can make that fifteen, even better – and half an hour is better still. If you make it more than that, you may have arguments at home

  - We say that other people are the cause of our sadness, but in reality, nobody can actually give you grief. Only we allow ourselves to become the recipients of such emotions or actions.

  - > **EXERCISE 5 : _Digital Distraction_**
    >
    > Have an offline time every day. Turn your phone off or put it on flight mode or disconnect the data for half an hour. You don’t need to know most of the constant chatter you get on social media, anyway.

  - Multitasking is one big sham. It’s far better, in my view, to do just one thing properly than have scattered energies trying to do multiple things.

  - > **EXERCISE 6 : _Personal Ritual_**
    >
    > Have a ritual, something that you hold sacred to your heart, that you can do mindfully and from which you receive some energy. That’s the tea ritual. But it could just be sitting down and playing a musical instrument too.
    > Don’t rate, berate or calibrate your life … celebrate it.

- ### **Kinhin and Sleep Meditation**

  - Kinhin is walking meditation. Zen gives you flexibility: You can do sitting, standing or walking meditation. You may do chado, the Zen tea ritual, or you could simply sit quietly.

- ### **The Nature of All Things**

  - _Paramita_ is transcendental: beyond the grasp of the senses, human intelligence or consciousness. Its literary meaning is perfection. Prajna means intuitive understanding. And this is what you really have to understand about meditation: there is nothing to understand. It is not knowledge you acquire.

  - That sahajajnana (natural wisdom) comes with quality practice over a prolonged period because with practice, what ancient masters called vipashya – which means insight – begins to dawn. And insight always leads to intuitive understanding.
    This is the focal point of Zen: a stage (or a state) where we no longer acquire wisdom or knowledge from books or methods. We get straight to the source – our own super consciousness that is flowing, a sense of being that is in harmony with everything around us in our daily lives. Deep insight arises naturally for such a practitioner.

  - The aerial view is enlightenment, the goal of meditation. It is what all prayers are about: to rise above ourselves. Buddha, with his disciplined practice, mindfulness and compassion, rose above the general pettiness of life and concluded that all forms, sensations and thoughts are empty.

  - He saw that panchaskandha, the five aggregates, of form (rūpa), sensation (vedanā), perception (samjnā), mental formations (samskāra) and consciousness (vijnāna) are empty.

  - Thoughts, feelings and consciousness exist in our minds and experiences but they are transient and, in the end, they don’t have any meaning at all.

  - You cannot come out of a negative emotion simply by wanting to come out of it. Shift your centre of awareness.

  - In Zen or in meditation, the idea is that you get to choose where you have your centre of awareness. If you can choose it, there will be very few problems in life then. Of course, there will be some pain, but with less suffering. Pain will still to be there: painful people, challenges and circumstances – they won’t go away, but you won’t suffer on account of such things.

- ### **The Raging Storm**

  - Without such mindfulness, we are repeatedly bothered and nudged by the same negative emotions. The cyclical nature of our thoughts and feelings is like riding an ever-moving Ferris wheel, each emotion being a different basket we sit in every time we ride, which is pretty much all the time.

  - Thoughts and emotions come like an aandhi , a raging storm. In those times, you just have to take cover and revisit your issues when everything has settled and is calm.

- ### **The Illusion of Suffering**

  - A life where there are no challenges is unfulfilling. It’s a very boring life, one not worth living, assuming it’s even bearable. Pain is an essential part of our spiritual progress. Whether our challenges are self-imposed or forced upon us, they make us work, think and appreciate the more desirable aspects of life.

  - The truth is we are fundamentally discontent with what we have. And if you are not content, you cannot be happy.

  - But always in the seed of expansion is the spore of destruction.

  - In all your low moments, only what comes from within you can help you.

  - All thoughts and suggestions come from your mind. If your mind can guide you objectively and realistically, then you would come out of that emotion faster.

  - You have to be calm before you can meditate. Meditation is your training to be calm afterwards, when you step out into the world.

  - Meditation is what you do to train your mind to tackle situations when you are not meditating.

  - Most of the love people express in words is not true. It’s just diplomacy or transient emotions, if not plain white lies – people going with the flow and making all these promises that today they really believe could change tomorrow. That is transience: it’s all temporary.

- ### **The Perfection of Wisdom**

  - When you don’t let go of your grace and goodness, irrespective of the circumstances, you are being divine. You have subscribed to this philosophy of grace and goodness.

- ### **The Temple of Life**

  - It’s remarkable how many of the problems of allergies, congestion or sinusitis you can take care of just by drinking hot water.

  - Yoghurt, or curd as it is normally called in India, is not good for most bodies. It’s tasty – there is no denying that – but it’s not good for you. If you cut down on it or remove it from your diet, you will not have so many allergies, especially with regard to the sinus, chest and throat.

  - Milk just sits in your tummy and kills your appetite. You cannot have a proper meal just after drinking milk.

  - Your body is a temple, a divine instrument, so treat it with care. No meditation is possible without a sound body.

- ### **Emotional Hygenie and Cleansing (Osoji)**

  - And it’s the things that we keep inside which affect our mental and emotional state. If I keep flowers in the room, what will I have? Fragrance. Whatever you keep around you is going to impact your surroundings. All the emotions inside us determine how healthy we are going to be, at least emotionally and from the perspective of consciousness.

  - Life’s problems will never end. Difficult people will always be in your life, as will challenges. There will be people who give you grief; there will be people who hurt you. None of that is going to change. Now that’s a given, what do you do? Do you not want to enjoy your silent moments? Do you want to keep complaining, keep crying? Are you going to keep worrying or are you going to do something about it?

  - Please take a notepad and write down the names of the people you feel negatively about, and the negative emotions associated with those names. Write down what you feel: I feel anger; I feel jealously, I feel envy.

  - Simply the name(s) of people and the negative emotion you experience at their thought.
    Do this with feeling, with sincerity; this is not just an exercise. You are making the commitment today that you are not going to be this person again – that you are truly forgiving these people. But only do it if you absolutely mean it; otherwise, it will have no impact. You don’t have to write the reason for your emotion, but if you want to, you can briefly mention a few words. The focus, however, should be on the emotion itself.
    Even if the person is dead, as long as you are holding the negative emotion, write it down.

  - After you finish writing, fold the paper(s), hold it in your hands, just cover it gently and sit peacefully. Now close your eyes and relax. And meditate as follows. (You could use other words if you like but this is just a guideline.)

  - Tear that paper into pieces, shred it or simply crumple it and chuck it in the trash can. It’s gone forever.
    Let. It. Go.

- ### **Zen Speech**

  - Knowing that everything is empty, and walking the path of meditation by simply meditating is not enough. That’s only the beginning of Zen. There are some virtues you cannot do without. If you are serious about progressing on this path, you must be equally serious about instilling those virtues in your daily life.

  - That’s why in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, he put yamas (restraints) and niyamas (positive duties or observances) before everything else: You ought to lead your life a certain way. There are many core virtues, but four are chief.

- ### **A Philosophy of Life**

  - The reason most people feel angry and unfulfilled in their lives is because they want someone else to make the choices for them. Making choices is hard work, it requires us to think things through, to ponder over the consequences of our actions. But, to have a chance at life, we’ve got to make our own choices, to stand up for ourselves, to take responsibility.

- ### **Compassion**

  - The key difference between an ordinary person who shows compassion every now and then versus an enlightened being is that the latter is more mindful of every opportunity and uses these chances to make a difference to someone’s life. Random acts of kindness fill our hearts with love, they make us warm inside.

  - The test of mindfulness or serenity is in adversity.

  - If we are forever bombarding others on account of how they are treating us, we will be caught in an eternal cycle of emotional hurt.

  - Everyone has a right to respect, and sometimes compassion is simply giving people their due respect, regardless of where they are in their lives financially, socially, intellectually, morally or spiritually.

- ### **Humility**

  - If you are humble, the person in front of you will undergo a subtle transformation. I have seen it happen on numerous occasions. But if you start to follow the other person’s energy or you react to the way he is talking to you or treating you, then there is no difference between you and him, anyway. You will feel equally disturbed with him as he with you.

  - You have to decide how you want to lead your life because people will always judge you.

  - Humility is not a display of diplomacy. It is a sense of being where the person next to you has as much right to life and dignity as anyone else. We all deserve each other’s respect no matter what the circumstances. If you ask me, humbleness is just another name for being truthful.

  - If people honour you, respect you, love you and want you based on a framework they have set up in their mind, they are unlikely to be true companions on your path.

  - If you stick to the truth, it will do its job. That is the key, and that is what I call humility.

- ### **Discipline**

  - The truth is that the more self-discipline we have to work on boring and mundane things, the more time we’ll have to work on free and fun things.

  > Discipline is freedom.

  - No matter how average or extraordinary our minds may be, if we have the discipline and the will to persist, any realistic goal is attainable then.

- ### **Forgiveness**

  - To keep any emotion alive requires feeding it and that is done by recalling who wronged you, when they wronged you and what they did to you. It makes you very restless. With all those monkeys running around in your home, how could you be at peace? One day, if you want peace, you need to open the door and let them go. And sometimes, it is as simple as saying, ‘Today I am opening the door and I am letting out all these emotions.

  - You decide what you want. To be proved right or to be at peace?

- ### **Sit Quietly**

  > _"All of humanity’s problems stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a room alone."_ ~ Blaise Pascal

  > **NOTE**
  >
  > Keep your eyes slightly opened and out of focus.
  >
  > Closing them will make you sleepy and sometimes busy.
  >
  > Opening them wide will keep you busy.

  > **EXERCISE 7 : _Manage Emotions_**
  >
  > When you feel distracted, don’t worry. You shouldn’t feel guilty or bad. Don’t feel frustrated or irritated. Simply listen to your breathing again, feel your breath.

  - If you do it daily, it will get into your bones. When something gets into your bones, it becomes your second nature – eventually becoming effortless. To get to that stage of effortlessness in any field, you have to go through a good deal of purposeful effort. The more mindful effort you put in, the quicker you will reach that stage of effortlessness, whether that’s in playing the flute or meditating or mastering any skill at all.

  - This excessive thinking leads to a lack of energy, and then your whole day feels like a drag. While you might use caffeine, drinking tea, coffee or some such items to give you energy, that zest for life is still missing. This is because your mind is tired.

  > If you do anything for about six weeks at a stretch without fail, it starts to become a habit, progressively becoming easier.

  - To be more in control of yourself, of your thoughts and feelings, the only way to go is inward.

- ### **Care for Your Body**

  - Your body is your first point of contact to do anything in life. If you are not exercising and not eating and sleeping well, you are not taking care of your body.

  - Please remember that meditation or any spiritual activity is not a substitute for a proper diet, sleep and exercise. It’s more a supplement – it’s supposed to complement your life and not take it over.

  - You have a duty: care for your own body as you would for your society. If you are going to neglect your body, how would you do anything?

  - The greatest minds in history accomplished what they did by mastering the art of working without distractions.

  - The online world can never be turned off; only mindfulness can get you out of it.

- ### **Learn to Handle Pain**

  - Only if we can learn to handle pain can we begin to see the beauty of life.

  > Pain is a natural part of life.
  >
  > Learn to accept it.
  >
  > Learn to take care of it as best you can.
  >
  > Decrease the complaining.
  >
  > Decrease the self-centeredness around it.
  >
  > Everybody has pain.

  - The more self-centered you are, the greater the pain you feel. If you observe happy people around you, you’ll see they are generally quite altruistic, eager to help others and live with compassion. Usually happy people, I’ve observed, are also good empathetic listeners. Less self-centered people are mostly content with their lives. They complain less.

  - Most days will be painful days – accept that. There are four kinds of pain in our lives – painful thoughts, painful emotions, painful actions and painful words. Either our thoughts are hurting us, somebody’s indifference towards us or the kind of emotion they are exhibiting is hurting us. Maybe their words and actions are causing us grief. It can even be all four.

  - Serving a cause or fulfilling a purpose expands our consciousness. Take up something bigger than yourself. Then you will become big – nature will have to make you that way. It will help you grow.

  - The point is simple: one easy way to handle your pain is to help someone else handle theirs. When you make a difference to someone’s life, nature will make a difference to your life. When you ease another person’s pain, Universal energy will help you relieve yours.

- ### **Practice Non-Violence**

  > Life belongs to those who love it.

  - Similarly, your life has a life of its own. If you love, value and protect it, it would want to be with you. It’s truly yours. But if you are going to hurt it, it will fly far, far away from you. Be kind, be gentle and the swan of life will come alive in your hands.

  - It’s all about how you handle life. It is what it is. If you deal with life compassionately, gratefully and delicately, you will discover that it’s every bit as beautiful and that it belongs to you wholeheartedly.

  > Don’t hurt what you want to keep. If you want to keep it, that is.
  > No violent thoughts.a
  > No violent emotions.
  > No violent words.
  > No violent actions.
