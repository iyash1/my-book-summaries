# Rich Dad Poor Dad

### Book by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter

- By automatically saying the words “I can’t afford it,” your brain stops working. By asking the question “How can I afford it?” your brain is put to work. He did not mean buy everything you wanted. He was fanatical about exercising your mind, the most powerful computer in the world. “My brain gets stronger every day because I exercise it. The stronger it gets, the more money I can make.” He believed that automatically saying “I can’t afford it” was a sign of mental laziness.

> “There is a difference between being poor and being broke. Broke is temporary, and poor is eternal.”

> Money is one form of power. But what is more powerful is financial education. Money comes and goes, but if you have the education about how money works, you gain power over it and can begin building wealth.

> Opportunities come and go. Being able to know when to make quick decisions is an important skill.

> Each human being has a weak and needy part of their soul that can be bought. And he knew that each human being also had a part of their soul that was strong and filled with a resolve that could never be bought. It was only a question of which one was stronger.

- “Remember what I said before: A job is only a short-term solution to a long-term problem. Most people have only one problem in mind, and it’s short term. It’s the bills at the end of the month, the Tar Baby. Money now runs their lives. Or should I say the fear and ignorance about money.

- If people are prepared to be flexible, keep an open mind and learn, they will grow richer and richer through the changes. If they think money will solve problems, I am afraid those people will have a rough ride. Intelligence solves problems and produces money. Money without financial intelligence is money soon gone.

> “If you want to be rich, you’ve got to read and understand numbers.”

- The above box is an Income Statement, often called a Profit and Loss Statement. It measures income and expenses. Money in and money out. The other diagram is the Balance Sheet. It is called that because it is supposed to balance assets against liabilities. Many financial novices do not know the relationship between the Income Statement and the Balance Sheet. That relationship is vital to understand.

- An asset is something that puts money in my pocket. A liability is something that takes money out of my pocket. This is really all you need to know. If you want to be rich, simply spend your life buying assets. If you want to be poor or middle class, spend your life buying liabilities. It’s not knowing the difference that causes most of the financial struggle in the real world.

- The Japanese were aware of three powers: “The power of the sword, the jewel and the mirror.” The sword symbolizes the power of weapons. America has spent trillions of dollars on weapons and, because of this, is the supreme military presence in the world. The jewel symbolizes the power of money. There is some degree of truth to the saying, “Remember the golden rule. He who has the gold makes the rules.” The mirror symbolizes the power of self-knowledge. This self-knowledge, according to Japanese legend, was the most treasured of the three.

- The middle class finds itself in a constant state of financial struggle. Their primary income is through wages, and as their wages increase, so do their taxes. Their expenses tend to increase in equal increments as their wages increase; hence the phrase “the rat race.” They treat their home as their primary asset, instead on investing in income-producing assets.

- This pattern of treating your home as an investment and the philosophy that a pay raise means you can buy a larger home or spend more is the foundation of today’s debt-ridden society. This process of increased spending throws families into greater debt and into more financial uncertainty, even though they may be advancing in their jobs and receiving pay raises on a regular basis. This is high risk living caused by weak financial education.

- The rich buy assets. The poor only have expenses. The middle class buys liabilities they think are assets.

- McDonald’s today is the largest single owner of real estate in the world, owning even more than the Catholic Church. Today, McDonald’s owns some of the most valuable intersections and street corners in America, as well as in other parts of the world.

- It is the knowledge of the power of the legal structure of the corporation that really gives the rich a vast advantage over the poor and the middle class.

- If you work for money, you give the power up to your employer. If your money works for you, you keep and control the power.

- The science of supply and demand. There is a need to know the “technical” aspects of the market, which is emotion driven;

- Employees earn and get taxed and they try to live on what is left. A corporation earns, spends everything it can, and is taxed on anything that is left. It’s one of the biggest legal tax loopholes that the rich use. They’re easy to set up and are not expensive if you own investments that are producing good cash flow. For example; by owning your own corporation — vacations are board meetings in Hawaii. Car payments, insurance, repairs are company expenses. Health club membership is a company expense. Most restaurant meals are partial expenses. And on and on — but do it legally with pre-tax dollars.

> Often in the real world, it’s not the smart that get ahead but the bold.

> It is what you know that is your greatest wealth. It is what you do not know that is your greatest risk.

> The reason so many talented people are poor is because they focus on building a better hamburger and know little to nothing about business systems.

> The main management skills needed for success are:
>
> 1. The management of cash flow.
> 2. The management of systems (including yourself and time with family).

- I have never met a rich person who has never lost money. But I have met a lot of poor people who have never lost a dime…investing, that is.

- Finding a good manager is more important to me than the real estate. A great property manager often hears of great deals before real estate agents do, which makes them even more valuable.

- They don’t make money because they chose to not lose money. Instead of analyzing, they close their minds to another powerful investment vehicle, the stock market.

- Without that little greed, the desire to have something better, progress is not made. Our world progresses because we all desire a better life. New inventions are made because we desire something better. We go to school and study hard because we want something better. So whenever you find yourself avoiding something you know you should be doing, then the only thing to ask yourself is “What’s in it for me?” Be a little greedy. It’s the best cure for laziness.

> “Guilt is worse than greed. For guilt robs the body of its soul.”

> “Do what you feel in your heart to be right—for you’ll be criticized anyway. You’ll be damned if you do, and damned if you don’t.”

- Arrogance is ego plus ignorance. “What I know makes me money. What I don’t know loses me money. Every time I have been arrogant, I have lost money. Because when I’m arrogant, I truly believe that what I don’t know is not important,”

- Arrogant or critical people are often people with low self-esteem who are afraid of taking risks. You see, if you learn something new, you are then required to make mistakes in order to fully understand what you have learned.

- Be yourself and be willing to not go along with the crowd. For in the market, it is usually the crowd that shows up late and is slaughtered. If a great deal is on the front page, it’s too late in most instances.

- The reason you want to have rich friends who are close to the inside is because that is where the money is made. It’s made on information. You want to hear about the next boom, get in and get out before the next bust. I’m not saying do it illegally, but the sooner you know, the better your chances are for profits with minimal risk. That is what friends are for. And that is financial intelligence.

- It makes no sense to invest, make money and blow it. It is the lack of self-discipline that causes most lottery winners to go broke soon after winning millions. It is the lack of self-discipline that causes people who get a raise to immediately go out and buy a new car or take a cruise.

> People who lack internal fortitude often become victims of those who have self-discipline.

> The three most important management skills necessary to start your own business are:
>
> 1. Management of cash flow.
> 2. Management of people.
> 3. Management of personal time.

- We live in the Information Age. Information is priceless. A good broker should provide you with information as well as take the time to educate you.

- All brokers are not created equal. Unfortunately, most brokers are only salespeople. I would say the real estate salespeople are the worst. They sell, but they themselves own little or no real estate. There is a tremendous difference between a broker who sells houses and a broker who sells investments. And that is true for stock, bond, mutual fund and insurance brokers who call themselves financial planners. As in the fairy tale, you kiss a lot of frogs to find one prince. Just remember the old saying, “Never ask an encyclopedia salesperson if you need an encyclopedia.”

- The real skill is to manage and pay well the people who are smarter than you in some technical area. That is why companies have a board of directors. You should have one, too. And that is financial intelligence.

- In the world of the “asset column,” being an Indian giver is vital to wealth. The sophisticated investor’s first question is, “How fast do I get my money back?” They also want to know what they get for free, also called a piece of the action. That is why the ROI, or return of and on investment, is so important.

- So wise investors must look at more than ROI; it’s the assets you get for free once you get your money back. That is financial intelligence.

- If your financial intelligence is low, money will run all over you. It will be smarter than you. If money is smarter than you, you will work for it all your life.

> “If you want something, you first need to give,”

> “God does not need to receive, but humans need to give.”

> _Moral of the story:_ Make offers. People who are not investors have no idea what it feels like to be trying to sell something.

- And I always make offers with escape clauses. In real estate, I make an offer with the words “subject to approval of business partner.” I never specify who the business partner is. Most people do not know my partner is my cat. If they accept the offer, and I don’t want the deal, I call my home and speak to my cat. I make this absurd statement to illustrate how absurdly easy and simple the game is. So many people make things too difficult and take them too seriously.

- The idea that it takes money to make money is the thinking of financially unsophisticated people. It does not mean that they’re not intelligent. They have simply not learned the science of making money.
