# How to Think Like Bill Gates

> ‘Life’s a lot more fun if you treat its challenges in creative ways.’

> ‘Smartness is an ability to absorb new facts. To ask an insightful question. To absorb it in real time. A capacity to remember. To relate to domains that may not seem connected at first.’

> ‘The worthwhile problems are the ones you can really solve or help solve, the ones you can really contribute something to ... No problem is too small or too trivial if we can really do something about it.’

> ‘Don’t compare yourself with anyone in the world. If you do so, you are insulting yourself.’ BILL GATES

> A winning team needs members who are all prepared to learn from each other.

> The future is what matters, which is why I don’t look back too often.’

> ‘We tell people that if no one laughs at at least one of their ideas, they’re probably not being creative enough.’

- A breakthrough is something that changes the behaviour of hundreds of millions of people where, if you took it away from them, they’d say, ‘You can’t take that away from me.’ Breakthroughs are critical for us. All we get paid for are breakthroughs, because people who have our software today can keep using it forever and not pay us another dime.

- ‘Believe me, when somebody’s in their entrepreneurial mode – being fanatical, inventing new things – the value they’re adding to the world is phenomenal.’

> ‘The only way to get access to strategic technology is to do it yourself.’

- Every three years are important in terms of redefining what we do. Any company that stays the same will be passed by very quickly and there are lots of fine examples of that ... I was always thinking that the environment [where] we did product development should be a fun environment, a lot like a college campus.

> Microsoft was one big team, he craved mini-organizations all functioning within the larger body. ‘Small teams can communicate effectively'

> ‘Conflict is at the heart of every significant Microsoft decision. This is a company constantly at war, not only with outsiders, but also with itself.’

- ‘Our great successes come with an approach of embracing anything that’s popular and then coming along with extensions ... to embrace everything that’s out there and make it easy for systems to co-exist.’

> ...that a truly great leader nurtures an organization that can prosper almost independently of its chief.

- Leadership for Gates is thus less about self-aggrandizement than about being in a position to see things are done to his exacting standards.

> ‘Don’t make the same decision twice. Spend time and thought to make a solid decision the first time so that you don’t revisit the issue unnecessarily.’

- He retains a wide-eyed belief that anything is possible and a youthful faith that he is the person to make it so.

- There become a few magic moments where you have to have confidence in yourself. You have a few moments like that where trusting yourself and saying yes, this can come together – you have to seize on those because not many come along.

> ‘Bill Gates is Microsoft ... The character of the whole company is cloned in the form of this combative, young, arrogant leader.’

- It is notable that many of the world’s greatest sportsmen report that the satisfaction they get from their greatest victories is relatively short-lived. Their desire to go on to scale new heights depends less on recapturing the joy of triumph than on avoiding failure.

> ‘Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can’t lose.’

- ‘Fear should guide you, but it should be latent. I have some latent fear. I consider failure on a regular basis.’ It is the ever-present concern that one is about to be found out that has driven him to cast an ultra-critical eye over achievements that most mere mortals would take as evidence of sublime excellence.

- ‘I’ve always been hard core about looking at what we did wrong. We’re not known for reflecting back on the things that went well. We can be pretty brutal about the parts that don’t do well.’

> But for Bill Gates, every failure is ultimately an opportunity to be better next time.

- There is a tendency in companies to let good news travel fast. Oh, we just won this account. Oh, things went so well. But the thing about good news is, it’s generally not actionable ... Bad news, on the other hand, is actionable ... The sooner you get the bad news, the better off you’re going to be, in order to kind of absorb it, to change your product plan, to go back and talk to the people, really dig into it.

- And like any great fighter, he strives to make sure his own game is up to scratch while looking for weaknesses in his opponent.

> ‘Our success has really been based on partnerships from the very beginning.’

- Gates grasped from the outset that rather than attempting to clear the playing field of all competition, he would be better served simply by keeping a close and critical eye on it. That way he could fathom when an alliance would bring benefits and, even more importantly, when his rivals were stealing a potential march. It is then that the demon wannabe chess master has emerged, as Gates’s brain whirrs to figure out how to shut down the opposition’s advantage and regain the upper hand himself.

- We focus on what other companies do well as opposed to what they do poorly. We don’t dismiss a company as unimportant just because a lot of things about it may be less than perfect. The company may be doing something important; it may not even know that it is important.

- Where some people get nervous if their ideas seem too different to everybody else’s, Gates revels in them. For him, there is rarely the self-doubt that wonders if an idea unshared is somehow intrinsically flawed. Like the greatest inventors and entrepreneurs, it is the search for the brainwave that has eluded everyone else that drives him on.

> ‘Business is a good game: lots of competition and a minimum of rules. You keep score with money.’

- ‘When you choose to get married and have kids, if you’re going to do it well, you are going to give up some of the fanaticism.’

> Optimism for me isn’t a passive expectation that things will get better; it’s a conviction that we can make things better – that whatever suffering we see, no matter how bad it is, we can help people if we don’t lose hope and we don’t look away.

- Throughout his adulthood he has striven to give an hour a day over to it, and more at weekends.

- for instance, he highly praised Marc Levinson’s `The Box: How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Economy Bigger`.

- Many of his book choices reflect his passion for addressing the great problems and crises that the world faces. So, for instance, he has read titles as disparate as

  1. `Paul Farmer’s To Repair the World`, the hugely apt How to Spend $50 Billion to Make the World a Better Place (a collection of essays edited by Bjørn Lomborg on the ten biggest challenges facing the planet today),
  2. Jeffrey Sachs’s `The End of Poverty`,
  3. Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner’s `Superfreakonomics` (according to Gates: ‘One of my favourite things in the book is the debunking of many of the studies economists have done that they use as the basis for claiming that people are irrational in their choices.’),
  4. Leon Hesser’s `The Man Who Fed the World` (a biography of Nobel Peace laureate and agricultural scientist Norman Borlaug) and
  5. Katherine Boo’s heart-rending study of modern Indian slum life, `Behind the Beautiful Forevers`.

- Brooks’s work is a great reminder that the rules for running a strong business and creating value haven’t changed. For one thing, there’s an essential human factor in every business endeavour. It doesn’t matter if you have a perfect product, production plan and marketing pitch; you’ll still need the right people to lead and implement those plans.

- ‘In giving money, you have to be as careful as you are in making money. You want to make sure it goes to good causes. And so, if you just spend it in an unthinking way, it can be gone in a second.’

- Humanity’s greatest advances are not in its discoveries, but in how those discoveries are applied to reduce inequity. Whether through democracy, strong public education, quality health care, or broad economic opportunity, reducing inequity is the highest human achievement.

> Opportunity, however, is worthless if one does not have the good health to take advantage of it.
