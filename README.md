# Book Summaries :books:

### What is this repository?

- My habit of making notes while reading created summaries of books I've read. They help me condense complex information to simple information, revisit topics of the books and mark good parts of the same.
- My intention to share these, is help people who
  - [x] aren't too much into reading but like to learn,
  - [x] want to understand broader subject of what book teaches,
  - [x] want to know what the book is exactly about before the start reading it,
  - [x] have already read the book but want to revise the subject discussed by the book,
- :warning: **In no ways these summaries are meant to be a replacement of actually reading the particular book, but as a companion only.** :warning:
- I highly recommend to read these very books I wrote the summary about and hope you enjoy them as much as I did.
